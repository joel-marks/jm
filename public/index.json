The introduction is arguably as important as the book itself; without it, the book falls prey to its own writing style.\nAlong with other ancient wisdom and philosophy, The Kybalion has become fashionable in contemporary discussion. This small book claims to be a distillation of ancient Hermetic Teachings (teachings attributed to Hermes), passed down from student to teacher by word of mouth over millennia. But do these claims hold true, and do the teachings have any inherent value?\nBrief overview # I found this book difficult to read for a number of reasons. The first is frustration with the lack of transparency. The volume is deliberately written and released in such a way as to generate a sense of mystique around it. It claims to be written by three people, yet in all likelihood was written by one. Richard Smoley comments that Atkinson may have been referring to an intellectual debt to Edward Maitland and Anna Kingsford.\nYou will find its chapters framed with quotes. The quotes are all cited as having come from The Kybalion, and the text then refers to the quotes as if they are a legitimate source. Circular reasoning, also known as self-referential fallacy, erodes credibility because it signals that the idea has no external validation. For a person to consider whether the \u0026lsquo;quote\u0026rsquo; has any internal truth, they have to ignore the author’s attempt to give the text intellectual weight through such obvious sleight of hand.\nThe book is written in the style of a religious text. The author, again, attempts to give credibility to the work by writing sentences in such a way that they are, perhaps deliberately, both hard to read and riddled with circular logic. Some readers might assume the lack of immediate understanding points to an underlying complexity. This is, in fact, far from the truth; the principles and ideas in the book could easily be written simply.\nFinally—and interestingly—the writing style involves frequent use of all-caps to denote importance in certain parts of the sentences. This might be a writing style of the day, or perhaps of the New Thought movement itself. The book Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill (1937), was published 29 years later, similarly making frequent use of caps and being deeply rooted in New Thought. It would be interesting to investigate the correlation between sales funnels and sales letters (particularly in the U.S.), marketing copy, and the use of all-caps as a means of creating sales conversions—and how this relates to non-academic texts that attempt to build audience.\nWhat we can say is that this book is an early, increasingly popular, and oft-commented-on book of the New Thought movement of the 19th and 20th centuries, probably written by an author who predominantly wrote about New Thought. The first edition was self-published, and the initially small number of copies might also have had an effect on its popularity. I doubt this was a deliberate form of scarcity marketing, but it may have had an effect.\nWhat the book says # The book puts forward seven axioms or principles of reality. Each one takes between four and five pages, and a proportion of the prose is dedicated to circular argument, meaning there is little depth. Of these seven, only the first two are truly Hermetic. The principles are:\nMentalism – All is mind. Correspondence – As above, so below. Vibration – Nothing rests; everything moves. Polarity – Everything has opposites. Rhythm – Everything flows in and out. Cause and Effect – Every cause has an effect. Gender – Everything has masculine and feminine principles. Richard Smoley, in his introduction, says: “The Kybalion … is part of a long-range trend in Western esoteric thought to move from the personal – from angels, spirits, demons, fairies – into the impersonal: vibration, polarity, causation.” I think this is possibly the most telling statement in the book.\nWhen The Kybalion is viewed through this lens, a number of things fall into place. We can see throughout the text numerous attempts to fit spiritual thought into the context of modern scientific reasoning. Given the book was written in 1908, much of this now falls flat. The science referenced was, at the time, still theory, and is long obsolete. There are some extended paragraphs which refer to occult esoteric \u0026lsquo;science\u0026rsquo; of the era, spiritualist cosmology, and mentalist metaphysics, which are stated as fact and have no basis in Hermetic wisdom.\nWe can see modern New Thought teachers doing the same thing, this time creating a metaphysical melting pot of ideas around, most frequently, quantum physics.\nAll is Mind: New Thought, philosophical Idealism and other TOEs # The chapter on \u0026ldquo;All is mind\u0026rdquo; is actually quite well written and an interesting way of engaging with the idea, if you have not come across it before.\nThe principle that \u0026ldquo;All is mind\u0026rdquo; strongly resonates with ancient thought, the earliest of which might be Daoism, but most succinctly with ancient Indian texts—the Upanishads (800–500 BCE)—in which Brahman is \u0026ldquo;pure undivided consciousness\u0026rdquo; and Atman, the individual soul, is identical to this universal consciousness.\nThere are modern thinkers and scientists whose ideas intersect with the concepts underpinning New Thought. As a philosophy, New Thought is so wrapped up in the commoditisation of the American dream of meritocratic capitalist society, its persistent use of pseudo science, and its sales tactics, that it is hard to see how it can be taken seriously. However, one of the founding principles, as stated in The Kybalion, is that \u0026ldquo;all is mind\u0026rdquo; —which is to say that matter comes out of mind, rather than mind being a by-product of matter. This flies in the face of most serious modern science and philosophy, but not all. Bernardo Kastrup has put forward a \u0026lsquo;Theory of Everything\u0026rsquo; (a TOE), called Analytic Idealism, in which he presents exactly this idea. Donald Hoffman, an evolutionary biologist, has put forward a theory that normal Darwinian evolutionary processes guarantee that we cannot see the \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; world. At a deeper level, he posits the idea that animals exist as minds that are connected to each other in a relational network.\nAnother way of looking at the principle is from the lens of Social Constructionism. It might indeed be argued that the entire New Thought \u0026lsquo;science\u0026rsquo; of \u0026ldquo;bending\u0026rdquo; the world to your will by presenting yourself in it with different (potentially more adaptive) thoughts and feelings can be explained entirely in the socially constructed domain —with the issue of synchronicities being considered as cognitive or confirmation bias. A simple example: if you walk into a room expecting strangers to treat you poorly, that expectation will be reflected in both your verbal and non-verbal communication—meaning other people in the room have to move beyond your social discomfort before they can co-construct a safe space with you for meaningful interactions. Success in social space (social capital) is strongly related to other forms of success in the human realm.\nAs above, so below # This is interesting from a modern perspective because we can look at it in two different ways. The first and most obvious is that the axiom suggests self-similarity in the universe occurring at different scales. To the modern eye, we understand this to be related to fractal mathematics. When we look at galactic scales, then human scales, then microscopic scales, we see patterns that have remarkable similarity. It is only at the quantum scale that this apparently breaks down. While modern science would not wish to speculate, the layperson might be tempted to think there is something at play in the broader ontology of existence. It is still a matter of philosophy rather than science.\nThe second point—and perhaps a stretch of the definition—is that reality, and particularly human consciousness, is in some way holographic. Rumi, the 13th-century Persian Sufi mystic and poet, is quoted as saying: \u0026ldquo;You are not a drop in the ocean. You are the entire ocean in a drop.\u0026rdquo;\nVibration # This is the part of the book—and indeed the part of the New Age and New Thought movement—that is the most difficult to comprehend and accept. It had its initial basis in the early understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum, but rapidly became a metaphor and cultural artefact, completely disconnected from reality. An example of its inbuilt inconsistencies can be found in its treatment of the word frequency. To be connecting with your higher self, or to be in a happy or spiritually elevated state, the parlance is to \u0026ldquo;raise your frequency.\u0026rdquo; However, the scientific data is unequivocal: high levels of cognitive function, such as driving on a busy motorway, occur at Beta and Gamma brain states, where brainwaves can be recorded between 30–100Hz. Meditation and psychedelic \u0026ldquo;transcendental\u0026rdquo; states actually lower the brain to Theta and Alpha waves between 4–13 Hz.\nThere is also a confusing mix of terms: Vibration, Polarity, and Rhythm are to some extent related—particularly in the scientific realm—so the book stumbles over its own desire to relate metaphors and philosophical ideas to the science of the day. A simple example is that for there to be vibration, there must be energy in the system you are measuring. Vibration, to exist at all, must occur between two opposite poles (polarity), and in some sense rhythm and frequency are interchangeable. What has not been measured is the amplitude. It’s easy to see that the 19th-century project to create metaphors that join science, spirituality, and philosophy has not aged well.\nIs it relevant or useful today? # I think The Kybalion is worth reading for a number of reasons. It’s small, and it won’t take long to get through. The use of repetition is noticeable, allowing the reader to skim large amounts of text. If you have any prior knowledge of the subject area, it is possible to read without having to think deeply about the content. The text forms a good introduction to many of the core tenets of New Thought —a spiritual, social, and self-help movement that is still thriving, with its primary consumer bases being the United States, Japan, Brazil, and India. It is sufficiently old that it slightly predates the rapid commercialisation of the genre.\nDo the seven axioms have the merit the author claims —for bending reality to your will? Almost certainly not. However, they have enough merit to consider as starting points for further personal thought, potentially useful as self-coaching prompts.\nSome examples might be:\n“What in my outer world is mirroring something within me? What internal change could create an external shift?” “Where am I seeing this as ‘bad’ or ‘wrong’ — and what’s the other pole of this experience that I haven’t explored yet?” “Where am I resisting the natural ebb or flow in my life? What would it look like to ride this wave instead of fighting it?” ","date":"6 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-08-06_review_the-kybalion/","section":"Posts","summary":"Review of The Kybalion","title":"Book review: The Kybalion","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"6 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/book-review/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Book-Review","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"6 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"6 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/post/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Post","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"6 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":" Expertise \u0026amp; Approach: # Trained in Clinical Hypnotherapy (ICCHP) \u0026amp; Solution‑Focused Practice (BRIEF).

In \u0026ldquo;The Solutions Focus, Paul Z. Jackson, Mark McKergow (2024 3rd ed.), p98\u0026rdquo; the authors make the statement \u0026ldquo;Stay on the surface -work with what you find. There is plenty to work with.\u0026rdquo; Teri Picho in converstaion with Mochi Landry [YouTube] states that Solutions Focus does not have a theory of pathology or change, it is a meta-model. So both the practice and theory of SFBT is \u0026lsquo;surface.\u0026rsquo; In the book \u0026ldquo;The Mind is Flat\u0026rdquo;, a theory of mind is put forward that is entirely consistent with this approach. As such, it is one of the few theories of psychology that speaks to the fundamental pre-conceptions of Solution Focused approaches.\nThe book is written in an accessible style for the lay-person, however it sometimes struggles to relate clear concepts. However, it will effectively take you on a journey through the author\u0026rsquo;s theory. This new theory challenges us to reassess our default model of consciousness based on experimental data.\nA new model of cognition # When you engage with the principles behind Solution Focus, you will be left with a lingering thought\u0026hellip; that the entire psychiatric model, especially its notions of subconscious and unconscious, is built on poor foundations. This book tells us why. It outlines a model of cognition and information processing grounded in scientific discovery, rather than metaphorical speculation. It frees us from the tyranny of \u0026lsquo;systems of belief\u0026rsquo; and behavioural drivers over which we have no control.\nSkip to P123 for a good synopsis by the author:\n\u0026ldquo;Pre-formed beliefs, desires, motives, attitudes (to risk) lurking in our hidden depths are a fiction: we improvise our behaviour to deal with the challenges of the moment rather than to express our inner self.\u0026rdquo;\nThe book observes that the brain is an improviser. It strives to improvise behaviour that is consistent with past behaviour and consistent with past interpretations of events. This implies we have much more flexibility in our options for behaviour than we sometimes think, given that we actually don\u0026rsquo;t have a subterranean system of beliefs or drivers.\nBlack box # \u0026ldquo;In science, computing, and engineering, a black box is a system which can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs, without any knowledge of its internal workings.\u0026rdquo; [wikipedia].\nThere is a fundamental mystery around our use of LLM AI (Large Language Model Artificial Intelligence), such as ChatGPT. Because of the way the neural net operates and is trained, we can assess the output of a query in terms of its usefulness given the input, but we have little understanding of how the answer was arrived at. It is also the case that we cannot ask the AI how it arrived at the answer without recursively hitting the same problem. The AI does not know how it works either. It might resort to telling us about the functioning of neural nets, weighted pathways between nodes, but this gets us no closer to the \u0026lsquo;how\u0026rsquo; of the answer. Additionally, the AI does not know anything about the hardware it is running on. AIs have been made in the lab which operate using lab-grown neurons with computer interfaces, while commercially available AIs run on silicon hardware. There is no possibility for the AI to investigate the hardware it runs on, as its operation is abstracted from its physical being.\nSimilarly, we humans are black boxes. A deep personal philosophical investigation of the root cause of any of our actions or behaviours is fraught with difficulty. Indeed, experimental data suggests that the mind as a whole comes to a decision before the reporting function, our language based sense of self, gets to know about it. In Buddhism, deep meditation has lead practitioners to the conclusion that there is, in fact, no \u0026lsquo;self\u0026rsquo; - a concept called \u0026ldquo;anatta.\u0026rdquo;\nWhile the book does not talk about AI, black boxes or Buddhism, examples are given of how easily we are deceived in our beliefs and decision-making processes, and the thesis goes some why towards implying a truth in the concept of anatta.\nGiven human consciousness is a black box, it is a matter of faith that we have such fundamental beliefs in ideas like \u0026rsquo;the unconscious,\u0026rsquo; and much of the theory of psychology built over the last century relies on assumptions that are not backed up by evidence.\nThe Mind is Flat will take you on a journey of discovery through the science that we do know about, and lead you to its fascinating conclusion - that we improvise everything. When asked what we think, we, just like an AI, invent a best fit response based on what we think we know and what we think the situation calls for.\nThinking beyond the experimental base for the book # But what about depth and selfhood? Are there any experiences we can have as humans that point to something beyond the improvised mind? Given that the book stays within the remit it sets itself (experimental data on cognition and behaviour) we have to look further afield.\nTranscendental revelation, sometimes (and often frightening) entirely spontaneous, but more frequently related to deep meditation, body practice or shamanic practice, can lead us to see and experience things we have no map for. Reports of meeting people who have passed, being in places we have never seen (Terrence McKenna reported that South American shamans claimed they had seen the Golden Gate bridge before having contact with westerners), and experiences apparently outside of time. Another common experience in shamanic practice is to observe higher order mathematical forms and prototypical language glyphs, regardless of having any training in mathematics or linguistics.\nAnother common but little discussed experience is that of past lives, for which we use the metaphor of reincarnation, and of NDEs and OBEs. I suspect that the author would seek to explain many of or all of these phenomena as simply spontaneous activity in the brain and our interpretation of it. The anecdotal evidence, such as it is, would point to a need for further research before drawing any such conclusions.\nFinal thoughts # My feelings after reading this book have been overwhelmingly positive. The thesis of the book holds its weight and encourages us to let go of some old ideas that may no longer be useful to us. The concept is usefully parsimonious, and takes a new approach to understanding the psychology of mind, one that seems in line with both Solution Focused practice and Buddhist philosophy.\nThe challenge will be to integrate this new model into a broader understanding of what it means to be human, one that includes our deep connectedness to each other, the universe, the nature of love and transcendent experience.\n","date":"6 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-02-06_review_the-mind-is-flat/","section":"Posts","summary":"Review of The Mind Is Flat, challenging the concept of mental depth","title":"Book review: The Mind Is Flat","type":"posts"},{"content":" Pricing # New clients: £750 for the inital 3 session package £250/session thereafter, coahing or personalised hypnotherapy with download Process for new clients # Free discovery call.

A teaching hook, used to get people to remember a point, but sometimes at the expense of a deeper understanding.\nBut was it right?\nTaken at face value we might pick up some issues with this idea.\nIs the message changing or not? # (a) The first is about the difference between static and dynamic information. The statement contains an underlying assumption that the message in psychedelics never changes, but is this true? If you had stocks and shares, or some crypto, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t check the value once. If you want to test water in a river for quality, you do not do it once. While the water as a system or body remains self-similar (it remains a river), the content of the water shifts constantly.\nSo does the content of the psychedelic state share the same properties? Is it static or dynamic? I think we could use the river metaphor again. There seem to be underlying themes. The great oneness of everything, a sense that the \u0026ldquo;being that is me\u0026rdquo; persists beyond the body and death, a feeling that love is the underlying principle of all things. But the content seems to shift as well. Perhaps this is because we ourselves are dynamic systems.\nAnother reason for returning to the experience might be that, in the absence of any other practice, our minds begin to revert to comfortable cultural patterns. Could \u0026ldquo;the western mind\u0026rdquo; be tide-locked into a socially constructed reality that is deeply dissonant from whatever the truth is? This would be something that a lifetime of Buddhist practice can start to unpick.\nMethod or quick-fix? # (b) The second is about whether plant medicines are a practice or a pill. Both Alan Watts and Deepak Chopra left psychedelics in their past. What they took up instead was a deep and lifelong spiritual practice that placed a lot of importance on meditation. They combined this with a teaching practice that they brought back to the West.\nMany people are attracted to plant medicines because they seek healing. Often, they know specifically what for. Anxiety, depression, addiction and trauma are particularly common. The medicine appears to do different things simultaneously, and we don\u0026rsquo;t yet have a deep medical understanding of what is going on. First, there is an experience of what it is like to have the brain flood with serotonin. For an anxious western mind that has not experienced deep meditation or anything similar, this is a game-changing experience. It demonstrates that a different mental state is possible. Secondly, there is the introspective journey into memory, which appears to both be healing in itself and to challenge the person to make changes, perhaps to heal relationships. Last of all, there is a loosening of the grip of the socially constructed world\u0026hellip; the beginnings of an awareness that all is not as it seems to be.\nMany western minds will approach plant medicine in the first instance with a medical model. Take the pill. Get better. For some this will work. Some get stuck here and struggle to integrate any further understanding. For others, healing takes longer. I was working with medicine for three years before I finally got to the truth about what was going on for me. But at this point, my work with the medicine had become a practice. I was not taking it to feel better, as that aspect of my journey happened within the first twelve months of work.\nWe see plant medicine being used as a practice in places where it has been used consistently for hundreds of years. For the Indigenous American Indians, or the Vegitalismo shaman of the Amazon basin for example, the use of psychedelic plants is a ritualised part of community life.\nIt is worth noting that Alan Watts himself would recognise this from his own tradition of Zen Buddhism. Meditation is not something you do once. You do not hang up the phone. It is a practice for precisely the same reason. The mind wants to wander into agitation, narrative and the safety of the socially constructed world.\nDoes the world need to wake up? # (c) Another point might revolve around the world as it is today. As we look around, do we think that we have collectively \u0026ldquo;got the message?\u0026rdquo; Allan Watts was born in World War 1 and lived through World War 2, the Cold War, the Korean and Vietnam War to name just a few. As I write this there is war in Ukraine as Russia tries to annex more territory, a war between Israel and Palestine, ongoing tension between US and Iran, North and South Korea, conflicts in Yemen and Armenia. Equally concerning is an ongoing and deepening divide in attitudes between urban and rural areas across the globe, as well as an anti-liberal, partly anti-establishment populism in Western democracies which is often swinging wildly to the right. This is in the context of what might be argued as a broadly liberal technology revolution that has seen the rise of ubiquitous and covert surveillance through a combination of data sets aggregated from email, mobile phones (tower positioning, GPS logs and back-doors in communication software) as well as CCTV cameras using AI powered analysis.\nWhile our technology and knowledge develops at an arguably exponential rate, so far our capacity for fear, greed, competition rather than co-operation remains unchanged. Conflict initiated by empire and inflexible ideology is underpinned by increasingly powerful military-industrial technologies.\nSteven Pinker might argue a different perspective, and it is well worth looking at his view on the development of our capacity to build a better world. Nonetheless, I feel that we have a lot to learn as a people, especially in regard to the environment and our capacity to be compassionate and community centric in our behaviour.\nPeople who take plant medicines for the first time sometimes jump to the conclusion that if everyone were to take them, the world would be a better place. This is not necessarily true. We have examples in the Inca of a community that used psychedelics regularly but was noted for its unparalleled brutality.\nIt is tempting to think that if more people had access to what is currently an often proscribed substance, we might start to slowly tip the balance as a society into a different way of being. The hippy communities in the 1960\u0026rsquo;s certainly believed it. The same could be said of meditation, demonstrating that there will be more than one pathway to peaceful coexistence. Yet power structures and the propensity to violence seem entrenched.\nShould we be symbiotic with the medicine? # (d) Terrence McKenna had a theory that the \u0026ldquo;fall into history\u0026rdquo; of the western mind, as he described it, was caused by our divorce from a practice of collectively eating psychedelic mushrooms. His thesis was that humans grew up in a symbiotic relationship to the plants that surrounded them, and particularly psychedelic plants, and that our intelligence, our social cohesion and our very sanity was dependent on this relationship.\nRather than hanging up a phone, perhaps he would think of humans as a race living down stream of a hydroelectric dam. Suddenly energy abundant and high-tech yet lacking the life giving waters that the community was based around. Thirsty and hungry, we start wandering the self-made desert, not realising that the dam is of our own making.\nWhat was the context really? # Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we are often given this quote out of the context of the paragraph in which it sat.\n“If you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones. The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the microscope, he goes away and works on what he has seen.” ― Alan Watts\nIn this, we see not an edict to drop psychedelic use entirely, but a call to action. The point being made was that psychedelic use in the absence of integration and then personal and community based action are without merit.\n","date":"17 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-10-17_was-alan-watts-wrong-about-the-phone/","section":"Posts","summary":"How to understand one of Alan Watts most famous quotes.","title":"Was Alan Watts wrong about the phone?","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"8 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/coaching/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Coaching","type":"tags"},{"content":" As a coach, you are likely to know a psychedelic user # In the past number of years there has been a renaissance of psychedelic use in the West which is sometimes known as the \u0026ldquo;Third Wave.\u0026rdquo; A large number of these users have come to psychedelics because they are seeking healing or change in their lives which they have not yet found a catalyst for.\nAt the same time, coaching as a profession, and in terms of the number of people seeking coaching, has experienced year-on-year growth. This allows us to imagine a Venn diagram, with ever increasing circles, one being psychedelic users and one being people seeking coaching. The intersection of these circles is a client group seeking coaching after using psychedelics.\nThis group is potentially larger though, because psychedelic users are often already open and looking for change, which means they are more likely to seek coaching.\nBut isn\u0026rsquo;t it dangerous or illegal? # Psychedelics, when used as a so-called \u0026lsquo;plant medicines\u0026rsquo; and psychedelics used in drug trials (for example, when researching treatment-resistant depression) have the same active compounds. In the latter case, psilocybin. The treatment rooms for the drugs trials took a lot of wisdom from the previous 40 years of illicit psychedelic use as well as native shamanic and neo-shamanic ceremonies when creating safe spaces for experiencers.\nThe outcomes for research so far have been very positive. There are risks when taking psychedelics unsupervised or without a medical assesment. Regardless many people in the west find legal or illicit avenues to persue healing on their own terms with shaman and ceremony leaders.\nDo coaches need to know about psychedelics # It seems increasingly likely that psychedelics will form part of the western mainstream model for treatment of depression and anxiety disorders sooner or later (depending on the country). There are already treatment centers available in some countries, and forming a legal, insurable treatment framework and decriminalisation are now the major hurdles before psychedelic treatment becomes normalised.\nIn this rapidly moving context, it would seem that coaches who are educated about psychedelics will be in a better position to meet their clients with understanding and without excess cultural bias. While most coaching models already have this standpoint built into their logic, the effects of the culture war against drugs, as well as some religeous standpoints, can introduce strong undercurrents of fear or dissonance between client and coach.\nAt worst, a coach might jump towards a safeguarding stance during a session where a client has disclosed psychedelic use, without knowing the dangers, or lack thereof, relating to use of a particular psychedelic.\nAre psychedelics better than coaching # In Solution Focused coaching, we focus on a preferred future and look for skills and resources that have previously been used or are currently being used. Psychedelics can take a person anywhere in their own psyche, however often the content of a psychedelic experience is self-reflective and focused on the past.\nSometimes this leads to an automatic process by which healing of these wounds occurs, however it does not always present the experiencer with obvvious ways to change in their present curcumstance.\nCoaching is an idea tool for creating a change in the present that will lead to a preferred future. So it might be considered an ideal scenario if a psychedelic experiencer were to seek coaching directly following the experience.\nSome coaches might argue that coaching is all that is necessary, however a review of the research shows that much more is going on in the brain than can be achieved through a coaching conversation. It might also be observed that no coaching methodology in the past 50 years has solved the issue of treatment-resistant depression.\nPsychedelic informed coaching # We are entering a new era in which mainstream and illicit psychedelic use for treatment of certain mental illnesses is becoming normalised in western cultures. All coaching models will find that going through a thought process about how the model intersects the needs of psychedelic users will benefit both coach and clients.\nI believe that Solution Focused approaches are idea for psychedelic experiencers, as they move the person from the past to the preferred future. Furthermore the model presumes that the client has the skills and resources necessary to make the changes they wish to see. This avoids pathologising the client. In short Solution Focused approaches consider the client to be the expert in their own lives and able to make change.\n","date":"8 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-04-08_psychedelics-and-coaching/","section":"Posts","summary":"Why it is important for coaches to be informed about modern use of psychedelics for healing.","title":"Psychedelics and coaching","type":"posts"},{"content":" Why become a coach? # Learning coaching techniques provides benefit to almost every walk of life. Coaching techniques, while often used in the workplace are equally effective in assisting positive change across the entire range of human endevour. Business, teamwork, collaboration, athletic performance, creativity, relationships, health, fitness, spirituality and wellbeing are just some of the things that coaches have developed specialised focus on. However anyone who learns coaching can apply the principles to themselves in order to facilitate change.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s so special about Solution Focused practice? # Many counselling and coaching methods start with the principle that in order to solve a \u0026lsquo;problem\u0026rsquo; we must first learn everything we can about it. This often presumes that a person with specialist domain knowledge, a psycho-analyst for example, will be invited to assist a client who, by definition, lacks this skill.\nSolution Focused coaching is different in two important ways. (1) It starts with the assumption that change is generated by the client, not the facilitator. It presupposes that the client already posesses the skills, resources and experience necessary to make any change they find necessary in their lives. (2) It does not agree with the connection between problem analysis and solving problems. Instead, it sees solutions as an emergent process that comes from clarity about what future is preferred.\nWhere can I start? # One of the things I love about Solution Focused work is that learning the fundamentals is reasonably easy. One of the hardest things is letting go of our encultured perception that problem analysis is linked to problem solving. That bad habit can be broken by studiously sticking to a set of reasonably pre-defined Solution Focused questions.\nAlmost everything you need to know about Solution Focused coaching can be learned by reading two or three books.\nThe first I would recommed is Brief Coaching by Iveson, George, Ratner. It is slightly more therapy centric, but it covers the princlples and gives many useful examples of Solution Focused conversations.\nThe second book, Next Generation of Solution Focused Practice, McKergow, gives a good grounding in the history and development of the technique, followed by an easy to use guide for Solution Focused conversations, the \u0026lsquo;Solution Focused Art Gallery.\u0026rsquo;\nThe third book is simply a long list of example questions. Between these three textbooks, you can gain a grounding in the principles and practice of Solution Focused coaching.\nIt is sometimes said that Solution Focused theory is easy, but in practice, can be more challenging. So the next step after reading is finding a practice group, or joining a course.\nSolution Focused textbooks ","date":"4 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-04-04_becoming-a-solution-focused-coach/","section":"Posts","summary":"How learning coaching skills can transform your life","title":"Becoming a solution focused coach","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"4 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/solution-focused/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Solution-Focused","type":"tags"},{"content":" Origins of solutions focused # Solutions focused approaches have their roots in family therapy models developed the 1960\u0026rsquo;s. A key step towards what is recognisable as SFBT (Solution Focused Brief Therapy) is the paper by Steve de Shazer, Change and Focused Problem Resolution in 1974. Developments in the model and papers on SFBT continue to this day, while the approach itself has yet to become mainstream.\nCounselling vs. coaching # There are many schools of counselling therapy, however most of them have a degree of focus on diagnosing or observing pathology, with the goal of addressing a range of pre-supposed underlying causes such as trauma or dysfunctional behavioural patterns (e.g. such as in family systems). Rogerian schools may focus on listening as a route to healing, whereas CBT encourages a more pro-active approach.\nCoaching can be defined as a useful conversation between two people, where the client is experiencing a level of wellness, or remission of symptoms, which allows pro-active behaviour towards a preferred change. Most private coaching clients self-refer, which is a further indication of having sufficient mental health to engage with the coaching process.\nCoaching is often used in work environments to increase or optimise employee performance, or in sports or creative professions. It is a growing industry with many diverse approaches and client groups. While coaching is a not a regulated profession, there is a degree of self-regulation and standards developmenmt in business coaching through avenues such as professional membership bodies.\nSFBT has an evidence base for being effective in therapy contexts for troubled clients, however, as a coach, I am particularly interested in the use of solution focused approaches in coaching contexts.\nProblems vs. solutions # Solution focused approaches, especially in therapy, attract the criticism that they ignore the problem and do not allow the client to disclose their troubles in a safe and understanding environment. SFBT understands the importance of listening to a client\u0026rsquo;s problem as a means to build rapport and trust.\nWhere Solution focused approaches differ is that they question the underlying assumption behind other therapeutic approaches. The assumption is that a careful analysis of the problem by a professional with expert knowledge is the key to developing a care plan that will solve the problem.\nWhile a solution focused practitioner will listen to the client\u0026rsquo;s problems, they are working with a different assumption: That the solution to a client\u0026rsquo;s problem cannot be found in an analysis of the problem itself, but in a focus on those aspects of a client\u0026rsquo;s life in which are working now and have worked previously. Therefore the practitioner will choose to guide the conversation in a way that will flow towards the client\u0026rsquo;s preferred outcomes.\nWhere solutions are found # In the book Brief Coaching, (Iverson, George, Ratner) 2012, the essence of solution focused coaching is described as\nto look for resources (not deficits) to explore possible and preferred futures to explore what is already contributing to those futures Mark McKergow has put forward the idea of a Solution Focused Art Gallery, as a metaphor to work through a solution focused conversation.\nThe gallery has four rooms. These rooms contain functional \u0026lsquo;chunks\u0026rsquo; of the conversation. Most solution focused conversations now contain these functional elements:\nTicket office What are the client\u0026rsquo;s best hopes for the future (developing a common project which acts as a contract between the client and coach for the duration of the conversation) Future gallery What does the ideal future look like (this new version of a preferred future is developed using the \u0026ldquo;miracle question\u0026rdquo;) Instances gallery Descriptions from past or present that align with client\u0026rsquo;s best hopes and preferred future Gift shop Appreciative summaries (from Next Generation of Solution Focused Practice, McKergow, 2001).\nProfessional development and membership # Coaching is generally an unregulated profession. Solution Focused coaching has a number of organisations that have developed and championed standards.\nIn the UK, the UKASFP (United Kingdom Association of Solution Focused Practitioners) is a membership organisation that also has a professional standards arm which assesses coaches and therapists against strict criteria for solution focused work. It also hosts an annual conference to exchange best practice and remain up-to-date on developments in the field. As of 2023 I work as a volunteer with UKASFP to assist them in their online strategic engagement.\n","date":"4 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-04-04_what-is-solution-focused/","section":"Posts","summary":"What is Solution Focused and why is it different from other coaching methods.","title":"What is Solution Focused coaching","type":"posts"},{"content":"Hi, I am Joel, a Solution Focused consultant coach and a clinical hypnotherapist.
