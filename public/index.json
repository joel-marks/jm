In \u0026ldquo;The Solutions Focus, Paul Z. Jackson, Mark McKergow (2024 3rd ed.), p98\u0026rdquo; the authors make the statement \u0026ldquo;Stay on the surface -work with what you find. There is plenty to work with.\u0026rdquo; Teri Picho in converstaion with Mochi Landry [YouTube] states that Solutions Focus does not have a theory of pathology or change, it is a meta-model. So both the practice and theory of SFBT is \u0026lsquo;surface.\u0026rsquo; In the book \u0026ldquo;The Mind is Flat\u0026rdquo;, a theory of mind is put forward that is entirely consistent with this approach. As such, it is one of the few theories of psychology that speaks to the fundamental pre-conceptions of Solution Focused approaches.\nThe book is written in an accessible style for the lay-person, however it sometimes struggles to relate clear concepts. However, it will effectively take you on a journey through the author\u0026rsquo;s theory. This new theory challenges us to reassess our default model of consciousness based on experimental data.\nA new model of cognition # When you engage with the principles behind Solution Focus, you will be left with a lingering thought\u0026hellip; that the entire psychiatric model, especially its notions of subconscious and unconscious, is built on poor foundations. This book tells us why. It outlines a model of cognition and information processing grounded in scientific discovery, rather than metaphorical speculation. It frees us from the tyranny of \u0026lsquo;systems of belief\u0026rsquo; and behavioural drivers over which we have no control.\nSkip to P123 for a good synopsis by the author:\n\u0026ldquo;Pre-formed beliefs, desires, motives, attitudes (to risk) lurking in our hidden depths are a fiction: we improvise our behaviour to deal with the challenges of the moment rather than to express our inner self.\u0026rdquo;\nThe book observes that the brain is an improviser. It strives to improvise behaviour that is consistent with past behaviour and consistent with past interpretations of events. This implies we have much more flexibility in our options for behaviour than we sometimes think, given that we actually don\u0026rsquo;t have a subterranean system of beliefs or drivers.\nBlack box # \u0026ldquo;In science, computing, and engineering, a black box is a system which can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs, without any knowledge of its internal workings.\u0026rdquo; [wikipedia].\nThere is a fundamental mystery around our use of LLM AI (Large Language Model Artificial Intelligence), such as ChatGPT. Because of the way the neural net operates and is trained, we can assess the output of a query in terms of its usefulness given the input, but we have little understanding of how the answer was arrived at. It is also the case that we cannot ask the AI how it arrived at the answer without recursively hitting the same problem. The AI does not know how it works either. It might resort to telling us about the functioning of neural nets, weighted pathways between nodes, but this gets us no closer to the \u0026lsquo;how\u0026rsquo; of the answer. Additionally, the AI does not know anything about the hardware it is running on. AIs have been made in the lab which operate using lab-grown neurons with computer interfaces, while commercially available AIs run on silicon hardware. There is no possibility for the AI to investigate the hardware it runs on, as its operation is abstracted from its physical being.\nSimilarly, we humans are black boxes. A deep personal philosophical investigation of the root cause of any of our actions or behaviours is fraught with difficulty. Indeed, experimental data suggests that the mind as a whole comes to a decision before the reporting function, our language based sense of self, gets to know about it. In Buddhism, deep meditation has lead practitioners to the conclusion that there is, in fact, no \u0026lsquo;self\u0026rsquo; - a concept called \u0026ldquo;anatta.\u0026rdquo;\nWhile the book does not talk about AI, black boxes or Buddhism, examples are given of how easily we are deceived in our beliefs and decision-making processes, and the thesis goes some why towards implying a truth in the concept of anatta.\nGiven human consciousness is a black box, it is a matter of faith that we have such fundamental beliefs in ideas like \u0026rsquo;the unconscious,\u0026rsquo; and much of the theory of psychology built over the last century relies on assumptions that are not backed up by evidence.\nThe Mind is Flat will take you on a journey of discovery through the science that we do know about, and lead you to its fascinating conclusion - that we improvise everything. When asked what we think, we, just like an AI, invent a best fit response based on what we think we know and what we think the situation calls for.\nThinking beyond the experimental base for the book # But what about depth and selfhood? Are there any experiences we can have as humans that point to something beyond the improvised mind? Given that the book stays within the remit it sets itself (experimental data on cognition and behaviour) we have to look further afield.\nTranscendental revelation, sometimes (and often frightening) entirely spontaneous, but more frequently related to deep meditation, body practice or shamanic practice, can lead us to see and experience things we have no map for. Reports of meeting people who have passed, being in places we have never seen (Terrence McKenna reported that South American shamans claimed they had seen the Golden Gate bridge before having contact with westerners), and experiences apparently outside of time. Another common experience in shamanic practice is to observe higher order mathematical forms and prototypical language glyphs, regardless of having any training in mathematics or linguistics.\nAnother common but little discussed experience is that of past lives, for which we use the metaphor of reincarnation, and of NDEs and OBEs. I suspect that the author would seek to explain many of or all of these phenomena as simply spontaneous activity in the brain and our interpretation of it. The anecdotal evidence, such as it is, would point to a need for further research before drawing any such conclusions.\nFinal thoughts # My feelings after reading this book have been overwhelmingly positive. The thesis of the book holds its weight and encourages us to let go of some old ideas that may no longer be useful to us. The concept is usefully parsimonious, and takes a new approach to understanding the psychology of mind, one that seems in line with both Solution Focused practice and Buddhist philosophy.\nThe challenge will be to integrate this new model into a broader understanding of what it means to be human, one that includes our deep connectedness to each other, the universe, the nature of love and transcendent experience.\n","date":"6 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-02-06_review_the-mind-is-flat/","section":"Posts","summary":"Review of The Mind Is Flat, challenging the concept of mental depth","title":"Book review: The Mind Is Flat","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"6 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/book-review/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Book-Review","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"6 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"6 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/post/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Post","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"6 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"Right click to download\nHybrid Stress Reduction Programme ▶ Play 8 minute Grounding hypno-meditation\n","date":"1 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/downloads/","section":"","summary":"\u003cp\u003eRight click to download\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 class=\"relative group\"\u003eHybrid Stress Reduction Programme \n    \u003cdiv id=\"hybrid-stress-reduction-programme\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca\n  class=\"!rounded-md bg-primary-600 px-4 py-2 !text-neutral !no-underline hover:!bg-primary-500 dark:bg-primary-800 dark:hover:!bg-primary-700\"\n  href=\"./Hybrid-SRP-8min-grounding-hypno-meditation.mp3\"\n  target=\"_self\"\n  \n  role=\"button\"\u003e\n  \n▶ Play\n\n\u003c/a\u003e\n  8 minute Grounding hypno-meditation\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Downloads","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"29 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/coaching/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Coaching","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/solution-focused/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Solution-Focused","type":"tags"},{"content":"A Solution Focused Parable #Umwelt #Field-of-affordances\nMakenda, from South Africa, Dr of Tropical Botany, University of Cape Town, South Africa. Marianna, from Spain, pilot and post-graduate geographer - travels the world as a consultant for civil engineering projects. Mike, from the UK, economist retrained, now teaching survival and bushcraft in Scotland UK. A crash landing # Makenda and Mike look anxiously out of the window of their single engine Cessna plane. Their pilot and friend, Marianna, has been taking them on a flight across Peru, to see Machu Picchu from the air, and then into the Amazon. But something is wrong. The plane engine is smoking, and they are looking for a place to land.\nSuddenly Makenda spots it. A small, flat clearing by a straight part of a river, one of the many tributaries to the vast Amazon. Makenda has always been good at observation. She grew up in the city and teaches tropical botany in a university in South Africa where they all met as undergraduates.\nMarianna\u0026rsquo;s father flew crop dusting planes in her home town in the Spanish countryside, so flying was in her blood. But her real passion was geography, and she would spend hours gazing at her Dad\u0026rsquo;s flying maps, trying to understand the lay of the land.\nShe takes the plane in a tight circle. She can feel the engine is close to failure, and she uses the river to drop speed and height as she angles into the bank. The landing demonstrates expert flying skills she didn\u0026rsquo;t know she had. The plane grinds to a halt, a wing clipping the forest just as it stops. Mike gasps, he didn\u0026rsquo;t realise he\u0026rsquo;d been holding his breath.\nAs they climb out of the plane the engine fire takes hold. They have just seconds to grab their bags.\nFrom the other end of the clearing, they watch the plane burn. Through the fog of shock, Mike starts to consider their situation. His degree in economics is no use here. But after ten years in London, he turned his back on the corporate life, retrained in survival skills, and started working for an outdoors centre in Scotland. Perhaps they can survive long enough to get to a village. But which direction should they go?\nThe clearing had been used by people for a while, yet nothing was left but a couple of rotten planks and dirt squares where some huts once stood. Still in shock, they find an old path, and walk into the edge of the forest. Several meters in they stop and look around.\nThe first look # In the panic, Marianna didn\u0026rsquo;t pick up the flight map and it was lost in the plane. But she has a knack for memorising maps. She knows from the flight plan and the sun which way is North. She recognised the river behind them and through the trees she sees a mountain she remembers from the map. There is a community to the West, perhaps a two or three day hike. They will have to get across the mountain and then follow the large river behind upstream. The village is on the river and there is a small airstrip there.\nMakenda is lost. She knew that the flight plan took them on a sightseeing tour, past the Inca ruins and into the Amazon. But this is nothing she prepared for. She looks at Mike. He has a frown. Mike knows survival, but every plant here looks strange. Indeed, some look downright dangerous.\nSame view, different eyes # As Marianna gazes at the forest, she sees an alien landscape. She knows planes, maps and the emergence of land use zones in cities. There are berries in several of the bushes. But they could kill her. It is a clear morning, but they have no shelter against the rain. She knows the way to go, but they need food and maybe fire. She feels desperate. Perhaps there are wild animals here. This is a dangerous place to be alone.\nMike looks at the same view. He knows maps too, but he didn\u0026rsquo;t memorise this one. The mountain, visible through the trees is one of many they passed. It could be anywhere. As he looks forwards, he sees a plant with huge leaves. The jungle is alien to him, but this plant could form the makings of a shelter. He turns in a circle. Behind them, by the clearing, he spots a fallen tree. Miraculously he can see dry deadwood as some branches have broken partially free from the trunk. He then sees some dry grass beside them. Within just 20 meters of their landing, they have the possibility of shelter and fire. But what are they going to eat? He knows survival in Northern Europe. Every plant here is strange.\nMakenda stands beside her friends. It is not her first time in the Amazon jungle. As a specialist in tropical rain-forest, she did her doctoral thesis on plants from the Amazon basin. There is a bush just three meters in front of them, full of berries which are not only edible but delicious. Just to her right, a tree with leaves that indigenous healers use as a medicine. But she grew up in the city. She has no idea how to cope with what will come next.\nSo what has this got to do with coaching? # Jakob von Uexküll first introduced the concept of Umwelt in his 1909 book titled Environment and Inner World of Animals. In this work, he explored how different animals perceive and interact with their environment based on their sensory capacities and subjective experiences.\nThe term gained more prominence and philosophical development in his later work, Theoretical Biology (1920), where he elaborated on the idea that every living being exists within a unique experiential world, shaped by how it perceives its surroundings.\nIn Solution Focused coaching we sometimes refer to this as the Field of Affordances. This is the sum total of the opportunities for action that you can see in the environment around you.\nWhen presented with the same clearing, forest and landscape, our three heroes see different things because of the skills, resources and experiences they bring to the moment.\nMarianna the geographer can see the big picture landscape, and can find a way back to civilisation. Mike the survival expert can see objects in the forest that can be used to create fire, shelter and perhaps even weapons for guarding against wild animals, or splints for a broken ankle. Makenda sees none of this, but she recognises almost every plant she sees, there utility for food, water and sometimes even medicinal use. Finding their way home # Our three heroes are on a path by a river bank. They\u0026rsquo;ve been walking for a week. They see the forest thin out in front of them, and then they step into a new world. Ahead of them is a beautiful vista. The forest has been cleared to make way for wooden buildings. Children are playing by the water. Several boats are moored up, and they can hear a generator. Weary but elated, they walk into the village. But how did they survive?\nWhy teams can achieve more Our first observation must be about teams. Alone, our heroes may not survive the jungle long enough to make it to safety. But together, their collection of skills will allow them to easily last a three day journey, or even longer. It will not be easy, but they can do it.\nWe sometimes forget that to be human is to be a communal animal. We are not a lone species; we have never wandered the savanna or jungles as isolated individuals -our power has always been in cooperation. A group of three can survive for a while. A tribe of twelve can survive even if one person is hurt. As teams get larger, the cost of collaboration increases (things take longer to achieve), but so does the benefit. It took many people to build the Golden Gate Bridge, but working as a collective towards a common goal created a miracle of engineering.\nThe power of coaching The second observation is about the Umwelt of each of our team members. As they talk to each other, they might uncover resources in themselves that they had forgotten about. Perhaps in the initial panic, one of them forgets that they learned in their twenties how breathing exercises can reduce stress and decrease blood flow in case of a trauma. Or maybe they might recall how, during the last year, they went on a team building away day and learned how to have conversations about trust and maintaining hope.\nHow mentoring, training and education expands our options for action Not only can our hero\u0026rsquo;s Unwelts be expanded through exploring their own skills, resources and experiences, but they can teach each other to see the forest in a different and more expansive way. Mike could teach Marianna how to make a shelter. Makenda can teach Mike how to collect edible fruit. It is the same forest, but it is no longer as frightening, because for each of them, they see a larger number of opportunities for personal and collective action.\nThe power of coaching # Expanding our world is the core of what coaching conversations are about, and is at the heart of the solution focused approach. This story has been adapted from an original to demonstrate the power of coaching, teams and mentoring, but its core observations are the same: we each look out at the same world, but see different opportunities for action. Both in life and in business, the act of having a \u0026lsquo;useful\u0026rsquo; conversation with a coach is a powerful tool to rediscover prior skills, resources and experiences which we can use to create powerful change in our lives, both at home and at work.\nBut by getting clarity on our preferred future, we will notice if the path towards it implies learning new skills. Solution Focused questions can remind us of our capacity for learning and our mental flexibility. The way forward is then apparent, and may not require further sessions, as empowered action is an emergent consequence of the conversation. This is the power of Solutions Focused coaching.\n__\nImage credits: Unsplash and Pexels.

A teaching hook, used to get people to remember a point, but sometimes at the expense of a deeper understanding.\nBut was it right?\nTaken at face value we might pick up some issues with this idea.\nIs the message changing or not? # (a) The first is about the difference between static and dynamic information. The statement contains an underlying assumption that the message in psychedelics never changes, but is this true? If you had stocks and shares, or some crypto, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t check the value once. If you want to test water in a river for quality, you do not do it once. While the water as a system or body remains self-similar (it remains a river), the content of the water shifts constantly.\nSo does the content of the psychedelic state share the same properties? Is it static or dynamic? I think we could use the river metaphor again. There seem to be underlying themes. The great oneness of everything, a sense that the \u0026ldquo;being that is me\u0026rdquo; persists beyond the body and death, a feeling that love is the underlying principle of all things. But the content seems to shift as well. Perhaps this is because we ourselves are dynamic systems.\nAnother reason for returning to the experience might be that, in the absence of any other practice, our minds begin to revert to comfortable cultural patterns. Could \u0026ldquo;the western mind\u0026rdquo; be tide-locked into a socially constructed reality that is deeply dissonant from whatever the truth is? This would be something that a lifetime of Buddhist practice can start to unpick.\nMethod or quick-fix? # (b) The second is about whether plant medicines are a practice or a pill. Both Alan Watts and Deepak Chopra left psychedelics in their past. What they took up instead was a deep and lifelong spiritual practice that placed a lot of importance on meditation. They combined this with a teaching practice that they brought back to the West.\nMany people are attracted to plant medicines because they seek healing. Often, they know specifically what for. Anxiety, depression, addiction and trauma are particularly common. The medicine appears to do different things simultaneously, and we don\u0026rsquo;t yet have a deep medical understanding of what is going on. First, there is an experience of what it is like to have the brain flood with serotonin. For an anxious western mind that has not experienced deep meditation or anything similar, this is a game-changing experience. It demonstrates that a different mental state is possible. Secondly, there is the introspective journey into memory, which appears to both be healing in itself and to challenge the person to make changes, perhaps to heal relationships. Last of all, there is a loosening of the grip of the socially constructed world\u0026hellip; the beginnings of an awareness that all is not as it seems to be.\nMany western minds will approach plant medicine in the first instance with a medical model. Take the pill. Get better. For some this will work. Some get stuck here and struggle to integrate any further understanding. For others, healing takes longer. I was working with medicine for three years before I finally got to the truth about what was going on for me. But at this point, my work with the medicine had become a practice. I was not taking it to feel better, as that aspect of my journey happened within the first twelve months of work.\nWe see plant medicine being used as a practice in places where it has been used consistently for hundreds of years. For the Indigenous American Indians, or the Vegitalismo shaman of the Amazon basin for example, the use of psychedelic plants is a ritualised part of community life.\nIt is worth noting that Alan Watts himself would recognise this from his own tradition of Zen Buddhism. Meditation is not something you do once. You do not hang up the phone. It is a practice for precisely the same reason. The mind wants to wander into agitation, narrative and the safety of the socially constructed world.\nDoes the world need to wake up? # (c) Another point might revolve around the world as it is today. As we look around, do we think that we have collectively \u0026ldquo;got the message?\u0026rdquo; Allan Watts was born in World War 1 and lived through World War 2, the Cold War, the Korean and Vietnam War to name just a few. As I write this there is war in Ukraine as Russia tries to annex more territory, a war between Israel and Palestine, ongoing tension between US and Iran, North and South Korea, conflicts in Yemen and Armenia. Equally concerning is an ongoing and deepening divide in attitudes between urban and rural areas across the globe, as well as an anti-liberal, partly anti-establishment populism in Western democracies which is often swinging wildly to the right. This is in the context of what might be argued as a broadly liberal technology revolution that has seen the rise of ubiquitous and covert surveillance through a combination of data sets aggregated from email, mobile phones (tower positioning, GPS logs and back-doors in communication software) as well as CCTV cameras using AI powered analysis.\nWhile our technology and knowledge develops at an arguably exponential rate, so far our capacity for fear, greed, competition rather than co-operation remains unchanged. Conflict initiated by empire and inflexible ideology is underpinned by increasingly powerful military-industrial technologies.\nSteven Pinker might argue a different perspective, and it is well worth looking at his view on the development of our capacity to build a better world. Nonetheless, I feel that we have a lot to learn as a people, especially in regard to the environment and our capacity to be compassionate and community centric in our behaviour.\nPeople who take plant medicines for the first time sometimes jump to the conclusion that if everyone were to take them, the world would be a better place. This is not necessarily true. We have examples in the Inca of a community that used psychedelics regularly but was noted for its unparalleled brutality.\nIt is tempting to think that if more people had access to what is currently an often proscribed substance, we might start to slowly tip the balance as a society into a different way of being. The hippy communities in the 1960\u0026rsquo;s certainly believed it. The same could be said of meditation, demonstrating that there will be more than one pathway to peaceful coexistence. Yet power structures and the propensity to violence seem entrenched.\nShould we be symbiotic with the medicine? # (d) Terrence McKenna had a theory that the \u0026ldquo;fall into history\u0026rdquo; of the western mind, as he described it, was caused by our divorce from a practice of collectively eating psychedelic mushrooms. His thesis was that humans grew up in a symbiotic relationship to the plants that surrounded them, and particularly psychedelic plants, and that our intelligence, our social cohesion and our very sanity was dependent on this relationship.\nRather than hanging up a phone, perhaps he would think of humans as a race living down stream of a hydroelectric dam. Suddenly energy abundant and high-tech yet lacking the life giving waters that the community was based around. Thirsty and hungry, we start wandering the self-made desert, not realising that the dam is of our own making.\nWhat was the context really? # Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we are often given this quote out of the context of the paragraph in which it sat.\n“If you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones. The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the microscope, he goes away and works on what he has seen.” ― Alan Watts\nIn this, we see not an edict to drop psychedelic use entirely, but a call to action. The point being made was that psychedelic use in the absence of integration and then personal and community based action are without merit.\n","date":"17 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-10-17_was-alan-watts-wrong-about-the-phone/","section":"Posts","summary":"How to understand one of Alan Watts most famous quotes.","title":"Was Alan Watts wrong about the phone?","type":"posts"},{"content":" As a coach, you are likely to know a psychedelic user # In the past number of years there has been a renaissance of psychedelic use in the West which is sometimes known as the \u0026ldquo;Third Wave.\u0026rdquo; A large number of these users have come to psychedelics because they are seeking healing or change in their lives which they have not yet found a catalyst for.\nAt the same time, coaching as a profession, and in terms of the number of people seeking coaching, has experienced year-on-year growth. This allows us to imagine a Venn diagram, with ever increasing circles, one being psychedelic users and one being people seeking coaching. The intersection of these circles is a client group seeking coaching after using psychedelics.\nThis group is potentially larger though, because psychedelic users are often already open and looking for change, which means they are more likely to seek coaching.\nBut isn\u0026rsquo;t it dangerous or illegal? # Psychedelics, when used as a so-called \u0026lsquo;plant medicines\u0026rsquo; and psychedelics used in drug trials (for example, when researching treatment-resistant depression) have the same active compounds. In the latter case, psilocybin. The treatment rooms for the drugs trials took a lot of wisdom from the previous 40 years of illicit psychedelic use as well as native shamanic and neo-shamanic ceremonies when creating safe spaces for experiencers.\nThe outcomes for research so far have been very positive. There are risks when taking psychedelics unsupervised or without a medical assesment. Regardless many people in the west find legal or illicit avenues to persue healing on their own terms with shaman and ceremony leaders.\nDo coaches need to know about psychedelics # It seems increasingly likely that psychedelics will form part of the western mainstream model for treatment of depression and anxiety disorders sooner or later (depending on the country). There are already treatment centers available in some countries, and forming a legal, insurable treatment framework and decriminalisation are now the major hurdles before psychedelic treatment becomes normalised.\nIn this rapidly moving context, it would seem that coaches who are educated about psychedelics will be in a better position to meet their clients with understanding and without excess cultural bias. While most coaching models already have this standpoint built into their logic, the effects of the culture war against drugs, as well as some religeous standpoints, can introduce strong undercurrents of fear or dissonance between client and coach.\nAt worst, a coach might jump towards a safeguarding stance during a session where a client has disclosed psychedelic use, without knowing the dangers, or lack thereof, relating to use of a particular psychedelic.\nAre psychedelics better than coaching # In Solution Focused coaching, we focus on a preferred future and look for skills and resources that have previously been used or are currently being used. Psychedelics can take a person anywhere in their own psyche, however often the content of a psychedelic experience is self-reflective and focused on the past.\nSometimes this leads to an automatic process by which healing of these wounds occurs, however it does not always present the experiencer with obvvious ways to change in their present curcumstance.\nCoaching is an idea tool for creating a change in the present that will lead to a preferred future. So it might be considered an ideal scenario if a psychedelic experiencer were to seek coaching directly following the experience.\nSome coaches might argue that coaching is all that is necessary, however a review of the research shows that much more is going on in the brain than can be achieved through a coaching conversation. It might also be observed that no coaching methodology in the past 50 years has solved the issue of treatment-resistant depression.\nPsychedelic informed coaching # We are entering a new era in which mainstream and illicit psychedelic use for treatment of certain mental illnesses is becoming normalised in western cultures. All coaching models will find that going through a thought process about how the model intersects the needs of psychedelic users will benefit both coach and clients.\nI believe that Solution Focused approaches are idea for psychedelic experiencers, as they move the person from the past to the preferred future. Furthermore the model presumes that the client has the skills and resources necessary to make the changes they wish to see. This avoids pathologising the client. In short Solution Focused approaches consider the client to be the expert in their own lives and able to make change.\n","date":"8 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-04-08_psychedelics-and-coaching/","section":"Posts","summary":"Why it is important for coaches to be informed about modern use of psychedelics for healing.","title":"Psychedelics and coaching","type":"posts"},{"content":" Why become a coach? # Learning coaching techniques provides benefit to almost every walk of life. Coaching techniques, while often used in the workplace are equally effective in assisting positive change across the entire range of human endevour. Business, teamwork, collaboration, athletic performance, creativity, relationships, health, fitness, spirituality and wellbeing are just some of the things that coaches have developed specialised focus on. However anyone who learns coaching can apply the principles to themselves in order to facilitate change.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s so special about Solution Focused practice? # Many counselling and coaching methods start with the principle that in order to solve a \u0026lsquo;problem\u0026rsquo; we must first learn everything we can about it. This often presumes that a person with specialist domain knowledge, a psycho-analyst for example, will be invited to assist a client who, by definition, lacks this skill.\nSolution Focused coaching is different in two important ways. (1) It starts with the assumption that change is generated by the client, not the facilitator. It presupposes that the client already posesses the skills, resources and experience necessary to make any change they find necessary in their lives. (2) It does not agree with the connection between problem analysis and solving problems. Instead, it sees solutions as an emergent process that comes from clarity about what future is preferred.\nWhere can I start? # One of the things I love about Solution Focused work is that learning the fundamentals is reasonably easy. One of the hardest things is letting go of our encultured perception that problem analysis is linked to problem solving. That bad habit can be broken by studiously sticking to a set of reasonably pre-defined Solution Focused questions.\nAlmost everything you need to know about Solution Focused coaching can be learned by reading two or three books.\nThe first I would recommed is Brief Coaching by Iveson, George, Ratner. It is slightly more therapy centric, but it covers the princlples and gives many useful examples of Solution Focused conversations.\nThe second book, Next Generation of Solution Focused Practice, McKergow, gives a good grounding in the history and development of the technique, followed by an easy to use guide for Solution Focused conversations, the \u0026lsquo;Solution Focused Art Gallery.\u0026rsquo;\nThe third book is simply a long list of example questions. Between these three textbooks, you can gain a grounding in the principles and practice of Solution Focused coaching.\nIt is sometimes said that Solution Focused theory is easy, but in practice, can be more challenging. So the next step after reading is finding a practice group, or joining a course.\nSolution Focused textbooks ","date":"4 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-04-04_becoming-a-solution-focused-coach/","section":"Posts","summary":"How learning coaching skills can transform your life","title":"Becoming a solution focused coach","type":"posts"},{"content":" Origins of solutions focused # Solutions focused approaches have their roots in family therapy models developed the 1960\u0026rsquo;s. A key step towards what is recognisable as SFBT (Solution Focused Brief Therapy) is the paper by Steve de Shazer, Change and Focused Problem Resolution in 1974. Developments in the model and papers on SFBT continue to this day, while the approach itself has yet to become mainstream.\nCounselling vs. coaching # There are many schools of counselling therapy, however most of them have a degree of focus on diagnosing or observing pathology, with the goal of addressing a range of pre-supposed underlying causes such as trauma or dysfunctional behavioural patterns (e.g. such as in family systems). Rogerian schools may focus on listening as a route to healing, whereas CBT encourages a more pro-active approach.\nCoaching can be defined as a useful conversation between two people, where the client is experiencing a level of wellness, or remission of symptoms, which allows pro-active behaviour towards a preferred change. Most private coaching clients self-refer, which is a further indication of having sufficient mental health to engage with the coaching process.\nCoaching is often used in work environments to increase or optimise employee performance, or in sports or creative professions. It is a growing industry with many diverse approaches and client groups. While coaching is a not a regulated profession, there is a degree of self-regulation and standards developmenmt in business coaching through avenues such as professional membership bodies.\nSFBT has an evidence base for being effective in therapy contexts for troubled clients, however, as a coach, I am particularly interested in the use of solution focused approaches in coaching contexts.\nProblems vs. solutions # Solution focused approaches, especially in therapy, attract the criticism that they ignore the problem and do not allow the client to disclose their troubles in a safe and understanding environment. SFBT understands the importance of listening to a client\u0026rsquo;s problem as a means to build rapport and trust.\nWhere Solution focused approaches differ is that they question the underlying assumption behind other therapeutic approaches. The assumption is that a careful analysis of the problem by a professional with expert knowledge is the key to developing a care plan that will solve the problem.\nWhile a solution focused practitioner will listen to the client\u0026rsquo;s problems, they are working with a different assumption: That the solution to a client\u0026rsquo;s problem cannot be found in an analysis of the problem itself, but in a focus on those aspects of a client\u0026rsquo;s life in which are working now and have worked previously. Therefore the practitioner will choose to guide the conversation in a way that will flow towards the client\u0026rsquo;s preferred outcomes.\nWhere solutions are found # In the book Brief Coaching, (Iverson, George, Ratner) 2012, the essence of solution focused coaching is described as\nto look for resources (not deficits) to explore possible and preferred futures to explore what is already contributing to those futures Mark McKergow has put forward the idea of a Solution Focused Art Gallery, as a metaphor to work through a solution focused conversation.\nThe gallery has four rooms. These rooms contain functional \u0026lsquo;chunks\u0026rsquo; of the conversation. Most solution focused conversations now contain these functional elements:\nTicket office What are the client\u0026rsquo;s best hopes for the future (developing a common project which acts as a contract between the client and coach for the duration of the conversation) Future gallery What does the ideal future look like (this new version of a preferred future is developed using the \u0026ldquo;miracle question\u0026rdquo;) Instances gallery Descriptions from past or present that align with client\u0026rsquo;s best hopes and preferred future Gift shop Appreciative summaries (from Next Generation of Solution Focused Practice, McKergow, 2001).\nProfessional development and membership # Coaching is generally an unregulated profession. Solution Focused coaching has a number of organisations that have developed and championed standards.\nIn the UK, the UKASFP (United Kingdom Association of Solution Focused Practitioners) is a membership organisation that also has a professional standards arm which assesses coaches and therapists against strict criteria for solution focused work. It also hosts an annual conference to exchange best practice and remain up-to-date on developments in the field. As of 2023 I work as a volunteer with UKASFP to assist them in their online strategic engagement.\n","date":"4 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-04-04_what-is-solution-focused/","section":"Posts","summary":"What is Solution Focused and why is it different from other coaching methods.","title":"What is Solution Focused coaching","type":"posts"},{"content":"Hi, I am Joel, a Solution Focused consultant coach and a clinical hypnotherapist.
