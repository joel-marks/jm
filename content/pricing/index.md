## Process for new clients

Free discovery call. A conversation to mutually assess whether we are a good fit to work together. You can ask me anything, and I will be looking at where you are in your journey.

1. Session 1 (around 1.5hrs). We will discuss in depth your desired outcomes, and look at skills and resources you already deploy. There will follow a training session in self-hypnosis, so you can learn how to get into state and take control of your own outcomes.

2. Session 2 (around 1.5hrs). Solution focused conversation, tracking changes and outcomes, drilling down into what works. Followed by a bespoke hypnosis on your agreed upon goals, moving the body into alignment with the mind. This personalised hypnosis will be available as a download.

3. Session 3 (around 1hr). Looking at what you've learned so far, tweaking approach, staying focused on outcomes.

I am available for free follow up consultation or referral.
